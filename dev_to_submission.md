*This is a submission for the [GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/github-2026-01-21)*

## What I Built
I built **Project Lifeline**, an autonomous CLI agent designed to tackle one of open-source's biggest threats: **Maintainer Burnout**. 

Project Lifeline uses the GitHub Copilot CLI as an "Autonomous Maintenance Engine." Instead of just chatting about solutions, the agent takes action. It triages open candidate issues, gathers local codebase context, and proposes technical remediation—like accessibility patches or CI/CD fixes. It then stages these fixes for human review, transforming maintenance from a manual chore into a simple "sign-off" workflow.

## Demo: Adopting cli/cli
Below is the output of Project Lifeline identifying and analyzing a candidate issue in the official GitHub CLI repository:

```bash
Project Lifeline: Autonomous OSS Maintenance Agent
Discovered 5 maintenance candidates:
[0] #12683: Invalid ANSI codes generated by `gh api`
[1] #12672: `workflow run`: Output created workflow run ID
[2] #12666: Login does not use GITHUB_API_URL...
[3] #12664: [FR] `gh project item-list` ; filter on assignee
[4] #12626: Enhance `gh pr create` flow

Select an issue to remediate: 4
INFO: Cloning cli/cli...
INFO: Agent processing remediation: Analyze and propose a fix for...
Success: Remediation complete for #12626.
Local workspace: e:\AI_Base\github-copilot-challenge\lifeline_workspace
Action required: Review the generated diff and stage the PR.

## Behind the Code
Moving from a "chatbot" to an autonomous agent workflow with `gh copilot` was the key breakthrough. 

- **Autonomous Loop**: By leveraging the CLI's agentic capabilities in a non-interactive shell, I was able to build an end-to-end maintainer loop. The AI doesn't just suggest code; it analyzes the *local* repository structure to ensure the fix actually fits the project's standards.
- **Solving Real Debt**: I focused on "boring" maintenance tasks—the kind that often leads to contributors leaving a project. Copilot is uniquely good at pattern matching these across large codebases, making it the perfect "adoptive" maintainer.

It moves the needle from "AI as an IDE helper" to "AI as a reliable infrastructure worker."

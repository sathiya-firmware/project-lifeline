*This is a submission for the [GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/github-2026-01-21)*

## What I Built
I built **Project Lifeline**, an autonomous CLI agent designed to tackle the leading cause of open-source decay: **Maintainer Burnout**. 

Project Lifeline uses the GitHub Copilot CLI as an "Autonomous Maintainer." It doesn't just chat about code—it takes action on neglected repositories. The agent autonomously triages open issues, clones the repository, analyzes the local context, and applies technical fixes (like documentation updates, accessibility patches, or dependency upgrades). It then stages these fixes as **Draft Pull Requests**, allowing human maintainers to simply "sign off" on critical infrastructure health without the manual labor.

## Demo: Adopting cli/cli
Below is the terminal output of Project Lifeline autonomously identifying and proposing a fix for a current issue in the official GitHub CLI repository:

```bash
=== Project Lifeline: The Open Source Maintainer Agent ===
[Lifeline] Triaging issues for cli/cli...
[0] #12683: Invalid ANSI codes generated by `gh api`
[1] #12672: `workflow run`: Output created workflow run ID

[3] #12664: [FR] `gh project item-list` ; filter on assignee
[4] #12626: Enhance `gh pr create` flow

## My Experience with GitHub Copilot CLI
The transition from a standard "chatbot" to an "autonomous agent" using `gh copilot` was transformative. 

- **Beyond Chat**: By using Copilot in non-interactive mode (`-p`) inside a Python script, I was able to chain complex engineering workflows together—moving AI from a "coding buddy" to a "background worker."
- **Social Impact**: The ability for Copilot to understand the *vibe* of a repository (its coding standards and issue history) through the CLI allowed me to build a tool that feels like it’s actually "adopting" a project to keep it alive.

It didn't just help me build the project; it provided the engine for a tool that can save digital infrastructure.
